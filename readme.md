# Description

This is a sample project of a NodeJS application that compiles, tests and deploys a Smart Contract in the Rinkeby Ethereum test network.

## Installation

Install the dependencies with

 ```bash
 yarn install
 ```

Due to a mix of dependencies and unstable versions of some packages this project has run on `node v12.16.3` or similar.

## Configuration

This project uses `dotenv` inject variables at runtime. Make sure to create one or include the account **mnemonic** in the `compile.js` file.

## Notes
